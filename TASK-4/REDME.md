Task 4: SQL for Data Analysis

Hello! 👋  
Welcome to my SQL Data Analysis project.  
This task was a great learning experience where I explored how raw data can be transformed into meaningful insights using SQL.

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a cleaned e-commerce dataset using SQL.
The goal was to import data from CSV files, clean it, perform analysis, and optimize queries using proper SQL techniques.

It was exciting to work with real-world data and understand how databases are used in practical business scenarios.

Objective
- Import structured data into a SQL database
- Clean and prepare data for analysis
- Perform analytical queries using SQL
- Apply joins, subqueries, and aggregations
- Create views for reusable analysis
- Optimize queries using indexes

Tools Used
- MySQL
- VS Code
- CSV Files
- Olist E-commerce Dataset

Dataset
The Olist e-commerce dataset was used for this project.
Only required columns were selected and cleaned before import to avoid errors and reduce complexity.
This made the dataset lightweight and easy to work with.

Project Structure
- Raw and cleaned CSV data files
- SQL scripts for import, cleaning, and analysis
- Screenshots of query outputs
- This README documentation

Steps Performed
1. Data Import  
   Created database and tables, then imported cleaned CSV files into MySQL.

2. Data Cleaning  
   Handled missing values, removed null and duplicate records, and standardized text formats.

3. Data Analysis  
   Used SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to analyze the data.

4. Views and Optimization  
   Created SQL views for summarized insights and added indexes to improve query performance.

Outcome
- Imported and analyzed structured e-commerce data using SQL
- Cleaned and standardized data for accurate analysis
- Applied joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to extract insights
- Created views for reusable analysis
- Optimized queries using indexes
- Gained confidence in working with real-world SQL datasets

Deliverables
- SQL scripts for data import, cleaning, and analysis
- Cleaned CSV files used for database import
- Screenshots of query outputs
- This README documentation

Final Note
This project strengthened my understanding of SQL and data analysis.
It was a joyful learning journey that helped me connect theory with real-world practice.
Looking forward to building more data-driven projects! 🚀
